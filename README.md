# **If The Script Crashes Please Make Sure:**



You Have Installed Python 3.9 Or Later



You Placed ONE file in the folder


Script Will Automatically Make The Folder For You


# **Data Loss**

When The Program Has Finished, A New Folder Will Be In The Directory Containing All The Files It Replaced.

DO NOT RELY ON IT!

If you use the script again in the same directory, the old fonts will be replaced with the previous fonts, not the original fonts.
Keep Backups Of The Fonts Just In Case.
